# Forsaken

### About
Forsaken is resource management iOS app in which you play as a survivor in a world desolated by a zombie outbreak. After your airplane crashes in an infested suburb, you must lead your crew to safety and try to rebuild using whatever supplies you can find.

### Details
- **Framework**: UIKit  
- **Language**: Objective-C  
- **Target**: iOS 7 and 8
- **Devices**: iPhone 5s

### Gameplay
The player has health, hunger, and thirst stats that they must remain aware of. Starvation and dehydration can lead to death if not treated soon.  
Different areas have different actions the player can choose from (e.g. collect water, harvest crops, cook food, etc.). Renewable actions such as these have progress bars that indicate when the action is completed. Other actions can only be done once (e.g. building tools, weapons, vehicles, etc.) and are completed immediately.  
The player may also leave their shelter to rescue other survivors, who will then join their colony. The player can then assign these survivors tasks around the shelter or send them on supply runs.

### Controls
**Tap** the available buttons to perform certain actions while in the shelter.  
During the road portion of the game, **tap and hold** the side of the screen in the direction you wish to move in order to avoid zombies.
